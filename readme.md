```

### And coding style üíª

It is written using PSR-4 and PSR-12 standard.

## Deployment üöÄ
```
echo "web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-apache2 public/" > Procfile
heroku create apiname
heroku config:set APP_KEY=
```
* all env file settings can be added on Heroku app/settings section.

To add a database is required a heroku plugin for data, it can be found 
in this link: (Heroku data section)[https://data.heroku.com], you can select a free or pay plan, and heroku provides a aws database.
then you need to match the database and the app, it can be handle in Heroku GUI, 
and then add some environment variables to heroku app 

```env
APP_URL=herokuurl
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=herokugenerated
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=herokudatabasenamegenerated
DB_USERNAME=herokuusernamegenerated
DB_PASSWORD=herokupasswordgenerated
```
### Add Paypal ID and Secret

(create your account on paypal sandbox)[https://developer.paypal.com]
(get id and secret)[https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications/]

Add this values to "env" file

```env
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID='yourId'
PAYPAL_SECRET='yourSecret'
PAYPAL_MODE=sandbox
```

All database keys are required to connect correctly with heroku database plugin, 
but the APP_URL key is required because Passport endpoint "oauth/token" redirects to base url.

finally we are going to change the composer.json file to reflect Heroku deployment needs

```json
    //in scripts object add
    "post-install-cmd": [ 
        "php artisan clear-compiled",
        "chmod -R 777 storage", 
        "php artisan passport:keys"
    ]
    //copy from require-dev object the faker version of your project to required object
    "fzaninotto/faker": "^1.4"
```

update composer to get changes and add the changes to Heroku

```php
composer update
```

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "wip"
git push heroku master
```
